You should learn Latin because
<ol type="I">
<li><h2>It expands your english vocabulary.</h2></li>
You could hear words such as "biology" or "pesticide" and immediately know what they mean.
<li><h2>It eases learning languages.</h2></li>
You would struggle less learning romance languages (Spanish, Portugese, French, etc.).
<li><h2>It looks good on resumés and other profiles.</h2></li>
It would distinguish you and, subjectively, could be quite impressive.
<li><h2>You could create mottos.</h2></li>

<li><h2>You could read ancient literature.</h2></li>
Have fun reading the Vulgate or Vergil's poetry!
